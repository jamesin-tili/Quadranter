# Quadranter
A program to divide things into 4 lists. Can be used e.g. as a importance vs. Urgency -based task prioritizer.

Only runs from Qt Creator (Qt 5.4) for now. Remember to copy 'settings.cfg' to the build folder for correct initialization.

TBD:
1. Save current state to file
2. Load current state from file other than 'settings.cfg'
3. Create stand-alone distribution
